    "  From the district data we can see that for the 15 schools in the district, more students tend to pass reading (85.81%) than math (74.98%), with only 65.17% passing both subjects. \n",
    "\n",
    "  Looking further at data for individual schools, we can see that the highest performing school based off of overall student passing rates are Cabrera High School, Thomas High School, Griffin High School, Wilson High School, and Pena High School in that respective order. The poorest performing schools are Rodriguez High School, Figueroa High School, Huang High School, Hernandez High School, Johnson High School. It should be noted though that the poorer performing schools often have 3-4 times less students than those of the highest performing schools.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Focusing on overall passing rate based off school size, it is evident that while there is not a significant difference in average scores for individual subjects, there is a significant increase in the passing rate for that of smaller to medium schools compared to that of large ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "  We can also see from scores based off school spending that spending both too little and too much per student is in correlation with lower overall passing rates. Spending over $1.70m per student causes scores to decrease drastically. \n",
    "\n",
    "  Finally, looking at scores by school type, we can see that charter schools overall performed oustandingly better than district schools. The passing rate for charter schools is approximately 40% higher than that of its district counterpart. \n",
